# Zabbix Kubernetes Operator

A Kubernetes Operator designed to automate the deployment, configuration, and maintenance of the Zabbix monitoring platform, including database integration and automated optimization tasks.

# Overview

This project aims to provide an efficient and automated way to manage Zabbix within Kubernetes clusters. Built with Operator SDK, it simplifies the deployment and ongoing management of the Zabbix Server, Frontend, and database integrations.

# Features

- Automated Deployment: Deploy Zabbix Server and Frontend with minimal configuration. 

- Database Integration: Connects to external databases with configurable credentials.

- Maintenance Jobs: Runs regular sanitization and optimization tasks for the database.

- Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs): Define and manage Zabbix instances easily.

# Roadmap

## Phase 1: Planning and Preparation

- Define project requirements and goals. :white_check_mark:

- Research Zabbix deployment and Kubernetes integration. :white_check_mark:

- Choose development tools (Operator SDK, Golang). :white_check_mark: 

- Set up a local Kubernetes environment (Minikube, K3s, Kind). :white_check_mark:

## Phase 2: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

- Initialize project structure with Operator SDK. :hourglass:

- Implement basic CRD for Zabbix deployment. :hourglass:

- Automate Zabbix Server deployment with database connection support. :hourglass:

## Phase 3: Core Functionalities

- Deploy Zabbix Frontend with service exposure. :hourglass:
 
- Configure persistent storage for Zabbix data. :hourglass:

- Implement automatic configuration management (e.g., zabbix_server.conf). :hourglass:

- Add maintenance tasks (database sanitization, optimization) using Kubernetes CronJobs. :hourglass:

## Phase 4: Testing and Documentation

- Develop unit and end-to-end tests. :hourglass:

- Provide clear documentation for installation and usage. :hourglass:

- Automate deployment pipelines (CI/CD). :hourglass:

## Phase 5: Advanced Features

- Implement monitoring and observability for the Operator. :hourglass:

- Enable dynamic scaling of Zabbix components. :hourglass:

- Add automated backup and restore functionality. :hourglass:
